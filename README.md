# Project 1 - Voice-Controlled Motor System

This project implements a voice-controlled motor system using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. The system recognizes specific voice commands to control motor operations, making it suitable for applications like voice-activated robotics or appliances.

## Features

- **Voice Command Recognition**: Utilizes a neural network model to interpret audio inputs and recognize predefined commands.
- **Motor Control**: Interfaces with motor hardware to perform actions based on recognized voice commands.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes audio inputs and controls motors in real-time, ensuring responsive operation.
## Commands List

| **Command** | **Description**                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Up**      | Command to move or increase position.  |
| **Down**    | Command to move or decrease position.  |
| **Left**    | Command to move left.                  |
| **Right**   | Command to move right.                 |
| **Stop**    | Command to halt movement or action.    |
| **Forward**      | Command to start or continue movement. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: 
  - Microcontroller (ESP32S3)
  - Motor driver (L298N)
  - Microphone module (Inmp441)
- **Software**:
  - [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/) development framework
  - [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers)


## Usage

Once the system is set up and running:

- **Voice Commands**: Speak predefined commands into the microphone. The system will process the audio input and control the motor accordingly.
- **Customization**: Modify the `main_functions.cc` file to add or change voice commands and corresponding motor actions.
